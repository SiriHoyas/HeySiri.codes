This is my portfolio page where I show all my projects.

## Description

As an aspiring front end developer, I wanted to make a portfolio to showcase all my projects to potential employers. Luckily, the making of an portfolio was a subject at the end of my first year at Noroff.

While I have some ideas to improve the site, and things I want to add, the site works great for showing my projects.
